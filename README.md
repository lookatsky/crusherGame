# crusherGame
A Crusher Board Game Implementation in Haskell.
This application finds the next best move for a crusher board game by generating a search tree of possible next boards, and perform min-max search on the search tree to pick the best move for selected player.
A simple heuristic is supplied to the min-max search algorithm to help evaluate the state of board.
